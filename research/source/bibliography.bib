  abstract={Medical Image segmentation is an important image processing step. Comparing images to evaluate the quality of segmentation is an essential part of measuring progress in this research area. Some of the challenges in evaluating medical segmentation are: metric selection, the use in the literature of multiple definitions for certain metrics, inefficiency of the metric calculation implementations leading to difficulties with large volumes, and lack of support for fuzzy segmentation by existing metrics.},

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the term used to
              describe the use of computers and technology to simulate
              intelligent behavior and critical thinking comparable to a human
              being. John McCarthy first described the term AI in 1956 as the
              science and engineering of making intelligent machines.
              OBJECTIVE: This descriptive article gives a broad overview of AI
              in medicine, dealing with the terms and concepts as well as the
              current and future applications of AI. It aims to develop
              knowledge and familiarity of AI among primary care physicians.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed and Google searches were performed
              using the key words 'artificial intelligence'. Further references
              were obtained by cross-referencing the key articles. RESULTS:
              Recent advances in AI technology and its current applications in
              the field of medicine have been discussed in detail. CONCLUSIONS:
              AI promises to change the practice of medicine in hitherto
              unknown ways, but many of its practical applications are still in
              their infancy and need to be explored and developed better.
              Medical professionals also need to understand and acclimatize
              themselves with these advances for better healthcare delivery to
              the masses.",

Various forms of image processing and image analysis are used to transform the raw image data into quantitative measures that are the basis of subsequent statistical analysis. In this article we describe the SimpleITK R package. SimpleITK is a simplified interface to the insight segmentation and registration toolkit (ITK). ITK is an open source C++ toolkit that has been actively developed over the past 18 years and is widely used by the medical image analysis community. SimpleITK provides packages for many interpreter environments, including R. Currently, it includes several hundred classes for image analysis including a wide range of image input and output, filtering operations, and higher level components for segmentation and registration. Using SimpleITK, development of complex combinations of image and statistical analysis procedures is feasible. This article includes several examples of computational image analysis tasks implemented using SimpleITK, including spherical marker localization, multi-modal image registration, segmentation evaluation, and cell image analysis.},

With the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare field the future care of our patients will depend on the decisions we make now. Demographic healthcare inequalities continue to persist worldwide and the impact of medical biases on different patient groups is still being uncovered by the research community. At a time when clinical AI systems are scaled up in response to the Covid19 pandemic, the role of AI in exacerbating health disparities must be critically reviewed. For AI to account for the past and build a better future, we must first unpack the present and create a new baseline on which to develop these tools. The means by which we move forwards will determine whether we project existing inequity into the future, or whether we reflect on what we hold to be true and challenge ourselves to be better. AI is an opportunity and a mirror for all disciplines to improve their impact on society and for medicine the stakes could not be higher.}

abstract = {Nine previously proposed segmentation evaluation metrics, targeting medical relevance, accounting for holes, and added regions or differentiating over- and under-segmentation, were compared with 24 traditional metrics to identify those which better capture the requirements for clinical segmentation evaluation. Evaluation was first performed using 2D synthetic shapes to highlight features and pitfalls of the metrics with known ground truths (GTs) and machine segmentations (MSs). Clinical evaluation was then performed using publicly-available prostate images of 20 subjects with MSs generated by 3 different deep learning networks (DenseVNet, HighRes3DNet, and ScaleNet) and GTs drawn by 2 readers. The same readers also performed the 2D visual assessment of the MSs using a dual negative-positive grading of −5 to 5 to reflect over- and under-estimation. Nine metrics that correlated well with visual assessment were selected for further evaluation using 3 different network ranking methods - based on a single metric, normalizing the metric using 2 GTs, and ranking the network based on a metric then averaging, including leave-one-out evaluation. These metrics yielded consistent ranking with HighRes3DNet ranked first then DenseVNet and ScaleNet using all ranking methods. Relative volume difference yielded the best positivity-agreement and correlation with dual visual assessment, and thus is better for providing over- and under-estimation. Interclass Correlation yielded the strongest correlation with the absolute visual assessment (0–5). Symmetric-boundary dice consistently yielded good discrimination of the networks for all three ranking methods with relatively small variations within network. Good rank discrimination may be an additional metric feature required for better network performance evaluation.}

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Over half a million individuals are diagnosed with
              head and neck cancer each year globally. Radiotherapy is an
              important curative treatment for this disease, but it requires
              manual time to delineate radiosensitive organs at risk. This
              planning process can delay treatment while also introducing
              interoperator variability, resulting in downstream radiation dose
              differences. Although auto-segmentation algorithms offer a
              potentially time-saving solution, the challenges in defining,
              quantifying, and achieving expert performance remain. OBJECTIVE:
              Adopting a deep learning approach, we aim to demonstrate a 3D
              U-Net architecture that achieves expert-level performance in
              delineating 21 distinct head and neck organs at risk commonly
              segmented in clinical practice. METHODS: The model was trained on
              a data set of 663 deidentified computed tomography scans acquired
              in routine clinical practice and with both segmentations taken
              from clinical practice and segmentations created by experienced
              radiographers as part of this research, all in accordance with
              consensus organ at risk definitions. RESULTS: We demonstrated the
              model's clinical applicability by assessing its performance on a
              test set of 21 computed tomography scans from clinical practice,
              each with 21 organs at risk segmented by 2 independent experts.
              We also introduced surface Dice similarity coefficient, a new
              metric for the comparison of organ delineation, to quantify the
              deviation between organ at risk surface contours rather than
              volumes, better reflecting the clinical task of correcting errors
              in automated organ segmentations. The model's generalizability
              was then demonstrated on 2 distinct open-source data sets,
              reflecting different centers and countries to model training.
              CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning is an effective and clinically
              applicable technique for the segmentation of the head and neck
              anatomy for radiotherapy. With appropriate validation studies and
              regulatory approvals, this system could improve the efficiency,
              consistency, and safety of radiotherapy pathways.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In radiotherapy, automatic organ-at-risk
              segmentation algorithms allow faster delineation times, but
              clinically relevant contour evaluation remains challenging.
              Commonly used measures to assess automatic contours, such as
              volumetric Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) or Hausdorff
              distance, have shown to be good measures for geometric
              similarity, but do not always correlate with clinical
              applicability of the contours, or time needed to adjust them.
              This study aimed to evaluate the correlation of new and commonly
              used evaluation measures with time-saving during contouring.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty lung cancer patients were used to
              compare user-adjustments after atlas-based and deep-learning
              contouring with manual contouring. The absolute time needed (s)
              of adjusting the auto-contour compared to manual contouring was
              recorded, from this relative time-saving (\%) was calculated. New
              evaluation measures (surface DSC and added path length, APL) and
              conventional evaluation measures (volumetric DSC and Hausdorff
              distance) were correlated with time-recordings and time-savings,
              quantified with the Pearson correlation coefficient, R. RESULTS:
              The highest correlation (R = 0.87) was found between APL and
              absolute adaption time. Lower correlations were found for APL
              with relative time-saving (R = -0.38), for surface DSC with
              absolute adaption time (R = -0.69) and relative time-saving (R =
              0.57). Volumetric DSC and Hausdorff distance also showed lower
              correlation coefficients for absolute adaptation time (R = -0.32
              and 0.64, respectively) and relative time-saving (R = 0.44 and
              -0.64, respectively). CONCLUSION: Surface DSC and APL are better
              indicators for contour adaptation time and time-saving when using
              auto-segmentation and provide more clinically relevant and better
              quantitative measures for automatically-generated contour
              quality, compared to commonly-used geometry-based measures.",
